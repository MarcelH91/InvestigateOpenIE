Comparison of articles Rails vs Django

Both frameworks encourage basic principles. This can be observed by looking at the predicates.

Ruby has more release information than django

Comparable degree of detail

Common attributes can be observed: 
open source web framework
MVC Pattern

Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern to organize application programming.
0,96 (Ruby on Rails; uses; the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern; to organize application programming)

A controller is a component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models directly for information and pass these on to the view. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use Representational state transfer RESTful routes, which include actions such as: create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes configuration file.
