?''Django'' is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python (programming language), which follows the model–view–controller Architectural pattern (computer science). It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

Also included in the core framework are a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing, a form serialization and validation system which can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the database, a template system that utilizes the concept of Inheritance (object-oriented programming) borrowed from object-oriented programming, a Web cache framework which can use any of several cache methods, support for middleware classes which can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions, an internal dispatcher system which allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals, an Internationalization and localization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages, a serialization system which can produce and read XML and/or JSON representations of Django model instances, a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine and an interface to Python's built in unit test framework.

Django may also be run in conjunction with Jython on any Java EE application server such as GlassFish or JBoss. In this case django-jython must be installed in order to provide JDBC drivers for database connectivity, which also provides functionality to compile Django in to a .war suitable for deployment.
